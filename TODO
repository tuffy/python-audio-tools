* DONE Fix WAVE/MP3 formats to support MP3 audio in a WAVE container
  Instead of WaveAudio generating a nasty "compression not supported" error,
  its is_type() classmethod should return False.
  And, MP3Audio's is_type() classmethod should check for MP3 compressed
  RIFF WAVE containers.
  This isn't likely to mess up decoding, but may confuse ID3 tagging.
* DONE Allow file template to be specified on the command line
  When making new files with track2track, cd2track, etc.
* DONE Update the website with the latest documentation
* DONE Allow a unified %(album_track_number)s file template field
  If there's no album number, it's simply 2 digits of track number.
  Otherwise, it's a combination of the two fields.
  For example, album_number = 2 and track_number = 13 results in
  "213" for a value.
* DONE Update trackcat to take a cuesheet argument when outputting FLACs
  Thus, one can perform:
  trackcat --cuesheet=file.cue file1.wav file2.wav file3.wav -t flac -o cd.flac
  which will embed "file.cue" into "cd.flac" using metaflac.
  Though no other format I'm aware of supports this kind of cuesheet handling,
  being able to easily build solid disc images of a single FLAC file
  is much of the reason for trackcat/tracksplit.
* DONE Don't remove undone tracklint entries from its undo DB
  Since its checksum will change anyway and no longer match,
  explicitly removing the entry is no longer necessary
* DONE Support FLAC padding
  If changes to FLAC metadata are small enough, write over the
  padding (if present) rather than rewrite the whole file - like metaflac.
  This approach should speed up tagging considerably.
* DONE Fix image support in ID3v2
  Very large images can take a very long time to load.
* DONE Fix programs to key on album number and track number
  Certain programs, such as trackcmp, work on tracks across two directories
  and key on track number to determine which to compare to which.
  These need to be updated to use both track number and album number.
* DONE Adjust wave conversions to use album number, if present
  For example, converting track_number 15 and album_number 2 to WAVE
  should make a file "track215.cdda.wav" which then properly converts
  back to track_number 15 and album_number 2 if read.
* DONE Improve XMCD handling
  Support for XMCD files often breaks down if one or more tracks
  are missing.
  In some cases, there's no fix to be had (track2xmcd)
  but in most instances it should be made to work correctly.
* DONE Perform type inference wherever possible
  Anything with a single output file (trackcat and record2track)
  should be able to infer its output type from the track suffix, if possible.
* DONE Add "comment" field support to all metadata types
  Don't forget to add unit tests for comment field.
** TODO Sort "comment" fields correctly across all metadata types
** TODO Add --comment support to tracktag
* DONE Fix ID3v2 image support to handle Unicode descriptions
  The current implementation falls down on UTF-16 input,
  but I should have a solution from the COMM frame handler.
* DONE Limit ID3v2.2/2.3 to UCS-2 encoding
  The current implementation treats UCS-2 the same as UTF-16.
  This needs to be fixed so that really high unicode characters
  (above U+FFFF) are replaced with something within spec.
* DONE Unify ID3v2 frame handling
  In the beginning, there were text frames and Everything Else.
  Text frames were unicode strings,
  and Everything Else was a binary string of whatever.
  Now that ID3 is cluttered with APIC frames and COMM frames that need
  special treatment, ID3v2 needs an overhaul to more resemble FlacMetaData.
** DONE Ensure unknown frames are displayed correctly
   Anything that's not text, images or comments should get some sort
   of proper display instead of a Python object string.
* DONE Add app testing to the unit test suite
  Though not everything is unit-testable
  (such as the CD handling programs or anything X11)
  a lot of the batch programs are to some degree:
- [X] coverdump
- [X] track2track
- [X] trackcat
- [X] trackcmp
- [X] tracklength
- [X] tracklint
- [X] trackrename
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] tracktag
* DONE Add verbosity levels to programs
  Every batch program should support a -V --verbose flag
  with options for "silence","normal" (the default) and "debug".
  Silence shuts off everything but error messages.
  Normal is standard output behavior.
  Debug for additional debugging output.
- [X] cd2track
- [X] cd2xmcd
- [X] coverdump
- [X] record2track
- [X] track2cd (this will need to forward verbosity to cdrecord)
- [X] track2track
- [X] track2xmcd
- [X] trackcmp
- [X] trackrename
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] tracktag
- [X] tracklint
* DONE Add compression percentage display to trackinfo
  Though not massively useful, it'd be neat to see just how
  compressed audio tracks are, as a percentage of their original size.
* DONE Add support for W??? frames to ID3v2
  The various W??? frames are really just URLs and don't need to
  be displayed as hex-encoded blobs.
* DONE Add CUE/TOC support to track2cd
  It should be possible to burn a selection of tracks, or a disc image,
  from a cuesheet with all its indexes/ISRC/catalog data intact
  by passing --cue to track2cd.
* DONE Unify CUE/TOC support
  Cuesheets and cdrdao TOC files are largely interchangeable.
  They both feature a listing of track offsets and, optionally,
  CD-TEXT data, ISRCs and so on.
  These formats should be unified such that any program will
  handle them both automatically.
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] trackcat
- [X] tracktag
** DONE Update docs to mention CUE/TOC interchangeability
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] trackcat
- [X] tracktag
** DONE Support cuesheet from FlacMetaData directly
   Since we're parsing CUE/TOC files anyway, this data can be used
   to build FLAC CUESHEET blocks directly instead of punting
   this task to metaflac.
** DONE Add unit tests for TOC/CUE files, as well as embedded FLAC cuesheets
* DONE Update copyright text for 2009
* DONE Preserve metadata when using trackcat
  Any fields shared by all tracks should be merged into metadata
  for the newly combined track.
* DONE Don't route data though WAVE files unless necessary
  Currently, track2track routes through WAVE if both ends happen to
  support foreign RIFF chunks, whether the files have such chunks or not.
  This behavior needs to be modified such that only source files
  which actually have foreign chunks, and a target format that supports them,
  results in a pass through RIFF WAVE.
* DONE Convert editxmcd to PyGTK
  Although the dialog(1)-based version works in terminals and is curses-based,
  it's extremely hokey, error-prone and doesn't support any cut & paste.
  This needs to be reimplemented in PyGTK (since coverview already uses it)
  and made into a stable app someone would want to use.
** DONE Update XMCD support
   The current handling of XMCD files treats them only as very primative
   AlbumMetaData implementations.  This must be updated into something
   round-trippable if editxmcd is to be modernized.
*** DONE Add XMCD unit tests
*** DONE Update XMCD API documentation
* DONE Require Python 2.5
  Since Python 2.4 is in bugfix-only mode and barely supported,
  it's best to move the minimum version to Python 2.5 or better
  (which has already been superceded by Python 2.6).
  This reduces the amount of Python versions to test on
  and allows the use of more modern Python features which
  makes the code less clunky.
** TODO Update documentation to mention Python 2.5 requirement.
* DONE Expand WavPack's APEv2 tag coverage
  WavPack's official specification defines APEv2 tags such as
  "Cuesheet" and "Cover Art" which the APEv2 standard does not.
  It would be helpful to make WavPack's APEv2 tags a superset of regular APEv2.
** DONE Add image support to WavePackAPEv2
** DONE Add cuesheet support to WavePackAPEv2
* DONE Build unified cuesheet interface
  Once both FLAC and WavPack support embedded cuesheets,
  there will need to be a unified interface to support them.
  I expect this will be a simple pair of get_cuesheet/set_cuesheet
  methods, probably attached to the AudioFiles themselves
  rather than to MetaData objects.
** DONE Alter FLAC-specific cuesheet documentation to be more general
** DONE Ensure cuesheets are transferred properly when transcoding
** DONE Update trackcat to use the interface
** DONE Update tracksplit to use the interface
** DONE Update track2cd to use the interface
** DONE Document cuesheet interface
** DONE Add unit tests for embedded cuesheets across all formats
** DONE Add cuesheet import option to tracktag
   This can also use the --cue flag,
   for consistency with other image-handling programs like tracksplit.
   If given with a single, album-length track, --cue will import a cuesheet.
   If given with multiple tracks or a single track that's too short,
   --cue will function like --xmcd and act as a metadata source.
** DONE Update track2xmcd to support getting an XMCD file from CD image
* DONE Convert to Muspack SV8
  Now that Musepack SV8 is finalized, it should be the new default.
  The old SV7 command-line tools aren't well supported and don't
  seem to work outside of x86 platforms.
  SV7 streams are, in theory, backwards compatible so switching
  shouldn't be a problem.
* DONE Update coverview to look more standard
  It's currently a haphazard assortment of widgets
  rather than anything like a proper GTK app.
  It should be tweaked to look better.
* DONE Improve transcoding robustness
  Just about all of the to_pcm() and from_pcm() methods expect
  that their subprocess calls will work as expected.
  Though rare in practice, these need to be checked in case
  the child processes fail for any reason.
** DONE Check for invalid input/output files/permissions errors
   If an output file can't be read/written to for some reason
   (invalid permissions, etc.) generate a proper error message
   instead of throwing ugly IOExceptions or confusing errors.

* DONE Make text output consistent
  Currently, command-line programs generate output using a
  selection of scattered print statements - often accompanied by
  if blocks when verbosity is indicated - and haphazardly
  filtered through unicode.
  This should be replaced by a unified message system similar
  to Python's built-in logging module which can abstract away
  these difficulties.
** DONE Convert tty output to gettext-based strings
   This will not only make output messages more consistent across the tools,
   but will also allow for foreign language translations in the future.

* DONE Integrate better MetaData merging
  There's a few areas in which MetaData from multiple sources must
  be merged in an intelligent manner,
  such as where tracksplit takes a source track an XMCD file.
  Now that a preliminary MetaData.merge() classmethod is in place,
  this process must be integrated consistently.

* DONE Improve M4A metadata handling
** DONE Make M4A metadata updating less destructive
  Like FLAC, not all fields need to be wiped out when overwriting
  old metadata with new.
** DONE Add more M4A-specific unit tests
* DONE Add more system information to audiotools-config
  All BIN-referenced binaries should be accounted for.
  Thumbnailing status and requirements should be shown.
* DONE Add cdinfo utility
  Analagous to trackinfo, but for an inserted CD.
  This would be a better location for cd2xmcd's "-i" option.
** DONE Add cdinfo man page
** DONE Link cdinfo man page to other utility man pages
* DONE Add manual page for audiotools.cfg
  It'll be easier to check what the options are from a man page
  rather than having to check the website or PDF doc.
* DONE Convert vorbiscomment dependency to Python
  This would remove the last app-based MetaData-setting utility
  and may pave the way for adding cover art to Ogg Vorbis
  (assuming I can find the standard for a secondary stream of image data)
* DONE Add metadata deletion capability
  It would be helpful to have the low-level capability of deleting
  either part of a MetaData tag or the entire tag altogether.
  For example, deleting the "track_name" field would delete
  a Vorbis comment's "TITLE" field.
  Or, deleting the MetaData from MP3 would remove all the ID3v2/ID3v1 tags.
** DONE Add delattr to ID3v1
* DONE Integrate pyconstruct as a submodule
* DONE Add undo capability to editxmcd
* DONE Add --cue option to track2xmcd
  One should be able to pull metadata from CD images
  without having to embed the cuesheet.
** DONE Add unit tests for track2xmcd's --cue option
** DONE Update man page
* DONE Group --help output more intelligently
  For tools with a large number of options (such as track2track or tracktag)
  the --help output is particularly jumbled.
  Use more of optparse's features to make this output clearer.

* DONE Check for FLAC metadata chunk overflow
  Although APEv2 and ID3 tags support very large objects (hundreds of MB),
  FLAC metadata chunks have a maxmimum of about 16MB per chunk,
  which may be hit accidentally.
* DONE Fix or replace Python's built-in aifc module
  The current implementation suffers from bugs.
** DONE Document AIFF better
* DONE Add MusicBrainz support
  It would be helpful to have external metadata support beyond FreeDB,
  since FreeDB is very primitive.
** DONE Ensure that MusicBrainz is interchangeable with FreeDB/XMCD
*** DONE Unify track2xmcd/track2mb, cd2xmcd/cd2mb
    Based on preliminary testing, MusicBrainz's output is better than FreeDB's
    but its album coverage is not as broad.
    In addition, nobody wants to run their albums through two separate tools
    in order to extract metadata for tagging.  The best solution is
    for tools to try both and output the one that's most complete.
*** DONE Extend editxmcd to MusicBrainz XML
    Although editxmcd was originally designed specifically for XMCD files
    and MusicBrainz's XML format differs radically, no one should have to
    know whether an album metadata file is one or the other.
    Therefore, editxmcd should be extended with additional fields
    to handle XML backend data if necessary.
*** DONE Handle multiple Release entries with single Disc ID
*** DONE Allow MusicBrainz XML output for new editxmcd files
    FreeDB output should also be an option, however.

** DONE Update documentation with MusicBrainz config file fields
** DONE Ensure missing XML fields are handled correctly
   The MusicBrainz XML spec allows most fields to be missing altogether
   (such as <title>).  editxmcd should add these fields in the proper place
   if necessary.
*** DONE Add unit tests for improperly reordered XML fields
* DONE Ensure .glade files are found
  Not all systems place Python data files in the same locations.
* DONE Convert to_pcm()/from_pcm() to FrameList-based I/O
  Passing specifically-sized blobs of binary data between conversion
  routines worked well when those routines are little more than
  subprocess black-boxes.  However, this approach works less well
  whenever actual sample values are required, or when processing is needed.
  In those cases, going from integers to strings, converting the strings
  back to integers for processing, then bouncing them into strings once
  again becomes needless work.
  A more sensible approach is to keep all data as FrameList-compatible
  objects (stored as C-based lists of int32s behind-the-scenes)
  and convert that data to/from strings only at the beginning and end
  of processing.
** DONE Build C-based audiotools.pcm.FrameList object
   This needs to closely match audiotools.FrameList's functionality
   and combine all the PCM conversion features from audiotools.pcmreader
*** DONE Integrate audiotools.pcm.FrameList with i_array structures

** DONE Check for memory leaks

   when checked with "help()"
* DONE Add native ReplayGain handling routines
** DONE Add native ReplayGain handling to FlacAudio/OggFlacAudio
** DONE Ensure add_replay_gain()'s exceptions are caught
   Errors during calculation may raise ValueError,
   which must be caught anywhere the function is called
** DONE Add ReplayGain unit tests
** DONE Ensure ReplayGain works properly on 8bps and 24bps output
** DONE Ensure ReplayGain is applied consistently
   Although cd2track and tracksplit are guaranteed
   to generate only one album at a time, track2track and tracktag are not.
   If multiple albums are applied gain at once,
   add_replay_gain must be called on an album-by-album basis
   rather than on the entire set.
** DONE Double-check ReplayGainReader
   Ensure its output is consistent with other implementations.
* DONE Fix multi-channel audio handling
  It's important that channel mapping information be preserved
  when transcoding between sources with 3+ channels.
  This likely means another flag for PCMReader so that
  from_pcm() can build a file with the proper channel mask set.
  However, it may also be necessary to build some sort of
  channel reordering mechanism in the event that formats differ
  on how channels are to be ordered in the file.
** Channel Counts and Ordering
| Format     | Maximum Channels | Ordering               |

** DONE Add unit tests to demonstrate new behavior
** DONE Update programming documentation with new behavior
* DONE Ensure embedded cuesheets aren't clobbered by adding more metadata
* DONE Adjust %(album_track_number)s to accomodate more than 9 albums
  For example, track 2 of 7, album 5 of 11 in format
  "%(album_track_number)s - %(track_name)s.%(suffix)s should be:
  "0502 - name.suffix"
* DONE editxmcd's "New" command should work with embedded cuesheets
  Selecting a single disc image with embedded cuesheets should
  fill in the proper XMCD/MusicBrainz fields
* DONE Ensure add_replay_gain used on hi-def tracks doesn't raise errors
* DONE Add Shorten support
  I don't expect people have a lot of shn files lying around
  and nobody should be using it for new data
  (though I'll add a rudimentary encoder for completeness' sake)
  but it's interesting to document for historical reasons.
** DONE Build complete decoder

   - [X] DIFF1
   - [X] DIFF2
   - [X] DIFF3
   - [X] QUIT
   - [X] BLOCKSIZE
   - [X] BITSHIFT
   - [X] QLPC
   - [X] ZERO
   - [X] VERBATIM
   I'll likely limit support to Shorten version2/3
   since generating older versions will be a challenge
   and this format is obscure enough as it is.
** DONE Build partial encoder

   - [X] DIFF1
   - [X] DIFF2
   - [X] QUIT
   - [X] BLOCKSIZE
   - [X] ZERO

*** DONE Convert partial encoder for standalone use
    To ensure there aren't any memory leaks
** DONE Add ShortenAudio type to audiotools Python core
** DONE Add Shorten-specific unit tests
** DONE Document Shorten
   - [X] Shorten data types
   - [X] the Shorten file stream
   - [X] the decoding process
   - [X] the encoding process
* DONE trackcmp should give exact PCM frame/byte of first mismatch

   - [X] test_trackcmp
   - [X] test_trackcmp1
   - [X] test_trackcmp2
   - [X] test_trackcmp3
   - [X] test_trackcmp4
** DONE update manual page to cover new behavior
* DONE Add analyzers for built-in decoders
  Analagous to flac(1)'s --analyze option,
  this will be an .analyze_frame() method that returns a Python dict
  of ints/lists/dicts containing frame data on each pass,
  or None at the stream's end.
  This will provide both an easier way to visualize the file's internals,
  and also a debugging aid.
** DONE FlacDecoder
** DONE SHNDecoder
** DONE ALACDecoder
* DONE Add more examples
  A lot of handy new features aren't documented with examples and walkthroughs.
  Examples to add include:
- [X] a full multi-CD example, detailing the use of --album-number
- [X] an image embedding walkthrough
- [X] a CD image creation, splitting, burning example involving TOC/CUE files
- [X] an XMCD walkthrough with fetching, editing and tagging
* DONE Update documentation to cover concrete MetaData classes
  - [X] ApeTag
  - [X] FlacMetaData
  - [X] ID3v1Comment
  - [X] ID3v22Comment
  - [X] ID3v23Comment
  - [X] ID3v24Comment
  - [X] ID3CommentPair
  - [X] M4AMetaData
  - [X] VorbisComment
* DONE Ensure man pages install correctly on Mac OS X
* DONE add a %(basename)s --format attribute
  For example, given the path: "/foo/bar/01 - track name.mp3"
  the %(basename)s attribute would be: "01 - track name"
  allowing one to ignore its internal metadata entirely
  and use original names.
** DONE Update AudioFile.track_name to support attribute
** DONE Update tools that call AudioFile.track_name
   - [X] cd2track
   - [X] track2track
   - [X] trackrename
   - [X] tracksplit
** DONE Update man pages for tools that call AudioFile.track_name
   - [X] track2track.1
   - [X] trackrename.1
   - [X] audiotools.cfg.5
** DONE Add unit test support for new attribute
** DONE Add documentation for new field to programming reference
** DONE Add documentation for format strings to programming reference
* DONE Update AudioFile.track_name classmethod
  the previous behavior was a kludge cobbled together over time
  Its new call method is:  track_name(file_path, metadata, format)
  so that track_number and album_number can be pulled from file_path
  directly instead of passed in from outside.
** DONE Update tools to support new calling method
   - [X] track2track
   - [X] cd2track
   - [X] trackrename
   - [X] tracksplit
** DONE Update programming documentation
** DONE Add unit tests
** DONE Update old unit tests with new behavior
** DONE unit test suffix field
* DONE Update Python code to support PEP 8
  Following accepted Python style should make the code more
  accessible and maintainable in the long run.
  It's also a good opportunity to clean up and simplify code
  without changing the actual API interface.

** DONE Build trivial binary delta routine
   Since most metadata formats make use of padding,
   we can use a simple XOR over their contents to generate
   a bidirectional patch that's optimized for tracklint's behavior.
   Since the bulk of such a patch should be NULLs,
   we can compress it with zlib/bz2 and achieve
   excellent compression.

* DONE indicate ReplayGain capabilities/binaries
  audiotools-config(1) should show what ReplayGain binaries are present
  and all audio classes that support it
* DONE update trackcmp to share trackverify's output interface
* DONE Add unary jump tables with a max value
  Since both Apple Lossless *and* WavPack have unary reading
  with a maximum upper limit of read bits, it makes sense
  to build a proper jump table for it.
  The size of our state limits the maximum to 8 bits,
  so larger maximums will be supported at a read_limited_unary() level.

  The trouble is, we need to differentiate between normal exits
  (we've hit the stop bit) and exits that hit the maximum value.
  So, the jump table itself must have a different syntax
  (probably an extra bit for "maximum value reached")
  and read_limited_unary() will likely return -1 in that event.

** DONE add some basic Bitstream writer unit testing
** DONE allow endianness swapping
* DONE integrate new endianness routines into existing routines
** DONE Convert Ogg verifier to proper little-endian operation
** DONE Swap endianness for proper FLAC VORBISCOMMENT writing
** DONE have bs_set_endianness create instruction in recorder-mode
   So that if we're recording an endianness shift,
   it gets set properly when "played back" to an actual writer.
   In fact, it may be a good idea to attach the set_endianness()
   function to the bitstream writer itself.

* DONE Update ALAC to handle multichannel audio
  What David Hammerton's reverse-engineered decoder described as
  a 3-bit frame footer isn't; it's actually a "stop" delimiter
  analagous to WavPack's block header stop bit.
  If it's not 0x7, keep reading frames and combine them
  channel-wise into a single multichannel chunk of output.

  iTunes and iPods still won't be able to handle such files,
  but XLD should be able to.

   It's a simple enough app that it should be able to conditionally do both,
   especially since audiotools does most of the heavy lifting.
   This allows it to look like a proper app under X11
   and work at all everywhere else.

   It should look and function approximately the same on both.

* DONE More graceful handling of broken files
  A lot of the track handlers assume that once the start of the file is good,
  the rest of it is following the spec.  This is not always the case.
** DONE All audio formats need to implement the error specification

   to_pcm() must return PCMReaderError if the decoder can't be built
   classmethod.from_pcm() must raise EncodingError if it can't encode file
   to_wave() must raise EncodingError if a wave can't be written
   classmethod.from_wave() must raise EncodingError if it can't encode file
   a failed to_wave() mustn't leave half-encoded .wav files behind
   a failed from_wave() mustn't leave half-encoded .wav files behind
   a failed from_pcm() mustn't leave a partially encoded file behind
   PCMReaders may raise IOError and ValueError on read()

** DONE Support reading offsets
   Without the horrible hack of reading the whole disc at once
** DONE Document audiotools.CDDA class
** DONE Document PCMReaderWindow class
* DONE Add support for System->cdrom_offset
  This will automatically apply offset samples when reading CDs
  so that rips will have the appropate amount of null samples.
** DONE Add offset support when ripping
   Automatically apply the configfile's cdrom_offset value to tracks
   during reading.
** DONE Add offset support when burning?
   cd2track and track2cd should round-trip properly
   If cd2track applies a sample offset when reading, does track2cd
   need to apply that same offset when writing?
   One would presume a drive's read offset and write offset are the same,
   but that may not be correct.
* DONE Add support for more lame encoding options
  Although the numerical presets are recommended,
  one should also be able to use the --preset values

* DONE Remove wavegain for applying ReplayGain to .wav files
  This should be done internally instead.
* DONE Add more verbosity to --quality settings
  For formats with varying quality, the "-q help" option
  should indicate what those settings represent.

** DONE Add ID3v2.2 option to audiotools-config
** DONE Add ID3v1 option to audiotools-config
** DONE Add ID3 number padding to audiotools-config
** DONE Document new audiotools-config options in man page
** DONE Document new audiotools config options on website
* DONE Add C-based FLAC encoder
** DONE Use VERBATIM subframes when necessary
** DONE Add significant initial padding blocks
   This will save a lot of time during retagging after FLAC creation
** DONE Add a variety of unit tests
   - [X] test_stream.sh
   - [X] test_flac.sh
** DONE Convert i_array size and data types to typedefs
** DONE Convert f_array size and data types to typedefs
** DONE Add more comprehensive encoding documentation
** DONE Add a variety of assert() statements
   As with unit tests, these ensure everything is working during testing
   without a performance penalty at runtime.
** DONE Handle foreign RIFF chunks
** DONE Ensure FLACs work on a variety of other decoders
   Although decoding properly on the reference decoder *should* guarantee
   the file works everywhere, the only way to be certain is to test it.
** DONE Ensure encoder raises the proper exceptions
** DONE Support Rice2 partitions?
   The reference encoder uses these for more efficient handling of 24-bit audio
   but I'm not sure they're strictly necessary for my more basic encoder.
** DONE Support wasted-bits-per-sample?
   I don't think I've ever seen these used on actual audio data
   that isn't artificial and hasn't been processed specifically for its use.
   As with Rice2, it's something that may get added later.
** DONE Handle multi-channel PCM data correctly
   Anything higher than 2 channels needs to set a channel mask
   and the vorbis comment to the proper value.
   I expect this will be a long-term project
   coinciding with re-engineering the to_pcm()/from_pcm() methods.
** DONE Remove external MD5 dependency
** DONE Generate SEEKTABLE blocks
* DONE Add UTF-8 to FLAC documentation
** DONE Explain how to decode a UTF-8 value
** DONE Explain how to encode a UTF-8 value
* DONE Add C-based FLAC decoder
** DONE Add a variety of unit tests
** DONE Handle Rice escape codes
   Not sure how to test these, but they should be handled properly.
** DONE Ensure decoder raises the proper exceptions
** DONE Handle empty MD5 sums correctly
   If the MD5SUM is 00000000000000000000000000000000
   it's never a mismatch and should not trigger an error.
*** DONE Update tracklint to populate an empty MD5 sum
*** DONE Add unit tests
**** DONE Ensure an empty MD5 doesn't trigger an error at read time
**** DONE Ensure an empty MD5 doesn't trigger an error at verify time
**** DONE Ensure tracklint populates an empty MD5 correctly
* DONE Add substream support to bitstream reader
  Its function is to allow one to pull pieces out of a larger bitstream
  and process them separately.
  For example, while parsing an Ogg stream's pages with one bitstream,
  the extracted Vorbis packets could be processed with smaller substreams -
  including substreams that span one or more pages.
  It's also potentially helpful for MP3, Ogg FLAC, DVD-A and any other format
  with nontrivial wrappers that need to be parsed seperately
  from the main bitstream.

* DONE Update FLAC/Vorbis to support TOTALTRACKS field for track_total

* DONE Eliminate the MetaData.merge() method
  The idea of this method is to provide some sort of precedence
  which combining metadata from two sources.
  For example, in track2track, we want provided XMCD metadata
  to override metadata inside the track itself.
  The .merge() method takes a raw MetaData object from XMCD
  and merges it with non-blank fields from the original file
  which means the XMCD metadata is the "base" of sorts.

  A cleaner approach would be to take the raw MetaData object from XMCD,
  get a list of its non-empty fields and call __setattr__ on
  the track's metadata to update those fields.

  MetaData with the highest priority would call __setattr__ last.

  Just as the bitstream module benefits from having a good design,
  the array module would also be better served by having

  The main goal is to have less function variants and
  data allocation/deallocation routines to remember.
  Something like:

  array = new_int_array();
  array->append(array, value);
  array->del(array);

  which always functions the same whether we're dealing with ints or
  floats or other arrays, yet is still type-checked at compile-time.

  I'd prefer to have a simpler, low-level, random-access reader hooked directly
  to the DVDATrack object - analagous to audiotools.cdda.CDDA.
* DONE Overhaul decoding/encoding documentation
  It needs to be cleaned up so one can better follow the entire
  decoding process, as well as the entire encoding process.

  and examples so that it can be followed with as little effort as possible.

* TODO Ensure non-image cuesheets are handled properly
  There are 4 different types of cuesheets,
  1 single file type and 3 different multiple file variants.
  We should be able to translate between them if necessary, and if possible.
* TODO Add support for genre tag?
  I'm not a big fan of the genre tag.
  Unlike track number, album name, ISRC, etc. in which a value
  can be reliably determined from the source material (e.g. back of the CD),
  genre is akin to a "rating" tag. Its value varies from person to person
  and this makes it less valuable for archival purposes.

  In addition, the genre tag itself is implemented in incompatible ways.
  APEv2 uses a chunk of text, ID3v1 uses an integer representing one
  of many designated genre labels, ID3v2 uses a mix of genre byte
  and/or text string, and so on.

  That said, the genre field shows up in a lot of players.
  So, some grudging support for it would probably be appreciated.
* TODO Convert TOC and CUE handling to proper grammars
  Although the current ad-hoc method works in most cases,
  it would be better to use a more formal method to parse these files
  which can be proven to handle all legal files.
  I expect this will require PLY or some similar lexx/yacc mechanism
  which I'll bundle to avoid adding any extra depencies.
* TODO Replace magic numbers with named constants
  There's still a few instances of magic numbers in use,
  in the __flac__.py module, for instance.
* TODO Support disc metadata submission
  If a disc is not found on FreeDB or MusicBrainz,
  there should be some mechanism to submit user-defined data
  to those services.
* TODO build track2cover/xmcd2cover utilities
  It would be helpful to have tools that could query
  online cover databases and retrieve images for tagging purposes.
  track2cover can replace coverdump, functioning like trac2xmcd
  which allows it to pull from existing metadata or from online sources.
* TODO build trackverify utility
  Much like flac(1)'s --verify option, this should check
  a file for correctness and, if possible, verify its output
  matches any internal hashes/checksums.
  May work recursively to check a user's entire collection.

  This may improve ease-of-use (particularly discoverability
  in the case of format and quality options) without sacrificing
  scriptability or command-line power.

  Just as the command-line options are kept as consistent as possible,
  all interactive modes will also need a consistent interface.

* TODO Deprecate little-used / poorly-tested bits
  Although there's a risk of annoying people by taking out
  stuff they might be using, some utilities and formats
  were added simply because it was easy and aren't tested
  enough for my liking.
** TODO record2track
   This needs to be rewritten to support multiple audio sources
   and constructed with a threaded GUI, or dropped.
   The current implementation is entirely too half-assed.
** DONE AACAudio
** DONE SpeexAudio
   I don't believe this format was ever meant for standalone use,
   and I doubt anybody is using it that way either.
   I just threw it in because it was easy and because
   I already had a lot of Ogg stream parsing infrastructure in place.
** TODO M4AAudio_faac
   The authors of faad/faac have moved on to neroAacEnc/neroAacDec.
   Even though M4AAudio_nero is also a hack involving intermediate
   wav files, at least it gets updated.
   Having two different, slightly incompatible M4A implementations
   needlessly complicates things.
* TODO Restore Monkey's Audio support
  This needs to be assimilated with a native decoder/encoder.
  I've seen these out in the wild, but only rarely.
* TODO Add True Audio support
  This compresses well and does seem to be used in some circles,
  so it would be a good idea to add.
  The tricky part is that its reference implementation doesn't compile well.

* TODO Handle write errors more gracefully
  Just as the BitstreamReader uses an exception mechanism to detect
  and handle read errors, the BitstreamWriter should use a similar
  mechanism to detect write errors and bubble-up a Python exception.

  The problem is that invalid writes are difficult to unit test.
  With a reader, one can simply truncate a valid file.
  It's harder to constrict a writer to only have X number of bytes
  available so that any errors can be checked.

* TODO Add lyrics metadata support
  Supporting storing lyrics text in the audio files themselves

** TODO Add .lyrics field to MetaData
   Analagous to the lengthy .comment field, most likely.
** TODO Add unit testing for .lyrics field
** TODO Find automated source for lyrics
   Analagous to CDDB.
   This will be challenging since online sources for lyrics are rare.
   Unfortunately, expecting everyone to transcribe lyrics for songs
   is unrealistic - even moreso than filling in song names
   or scanning in covers by hand.
   If it's too much work, there's little point in having it.
** TODO Add tool support for lyrics
** TODO Add unit testing to tools
* TODO Convert format reference to HTML
  Not only would it be more accessible,
  but I could better integrate examples and give it basic interactivity.
  All of the diagrams and formulas must be kept as vector art
  so that they'll remain crisp when scaled.

  Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't do MathML and IE doesn't do SVG
  which makes it non-viable right now.
* TODO Shift to Cython?
  Rather than push toward Python 3, which is slower than 2
  and not yet as widely supported, it may be better to shift toward
  Cython for handling lots of low-level file processing.
  It would add a dependency, but has the potential to make
  chunks of the code faster and smaller.
* TODO Add Python-based file decoders
  These would be low-performance, Python-based PCMReader-style objects
  demonstrating how the decoding process works in a relatively simple
  manner through the use of the BitstreamReader objects.
  They would also provide reference implementations.

* TODO Fix --number=0 argument to tracktag
  I'd like to make track_number=0 a valid value
  and have track_number=None indicate a missing field.
  The problem is maintaining consistency between
  metadata formats that store track numbers as text (like ID3v2)
  and those that store track numbers as integers (like M4A).
* TODO Add internal Ogg FLAC encoder
  This shouldn't be too hard since native FLAC encoding is already in place,
  as is Ogg stream encoding.
* TODO Split off tracktag's functionality
** TODO Move the image options into a specialized tool (covertag?)

  Taking a byte count as an argument is a relic from the days
  when most conversion happened through external programs.
  It's time to update this function to work on PCM frames instead
  which is much more natural fit and makes many calculations much easier.
* TODO Finish version 2.18
** DONE Ensure audiotools works on FreeBSD

** TODO Add update_metadata() method to AudioFile
   Consider how AudioFile.set_metadata() handles six different cases:

   Case 1: adjusting a file's own textual metadata (tracktag)
   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.track_name = u"Fixed Name"
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(m)

   Case 2: transferring metadata from the same audio type (track2track)
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(flac2.get_metadata())

   Case 3: transferring metadata from a different audio type (track2track)
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(mp3.get_metadata())

   Case 4: adjusting a file's own low-level metadata (tracklint)
   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.streaminfo.md5sum = fixed_md5sum
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(m)

   Case 5: building new metadata from scratch (cd2track)
   >>> flac1 = FlacAudio.from_pcm(pcm_reader)
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(MetaData(track_name=u"New Name", ...))

   Case 6: transferring adjusted metadata from the same audio type
   >>> m = flac2.get_metadata()
   >>> m.track_name = u"Adjusted Name"
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(m)

   What happens to stuff like the STREAMINFO block
   which contains track length, md5sum, etc.
   and is part of FLAC's metadata?

   If set_metadata() works naively and doesn't override any values,
   case 2 breaks since flac1 suddenly has flac2's track length.

   If set_metadata() overrides new metadata with stuff from the current file,
   case 4 breaks since the fixed_md5sum gets overridden.

   Counting on set_metadata() being smart enough to know what you mean
   is a losing proposition for FLAC, M4A and other metadata formats
   with embedded non-textual (side) metadata.

   One solution is to add a low-level AudioFile.update_metadata() method
   which takes only the AudioFile's required metadata type
   and leaves side data as-is.  So case 1 becomes:

   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.track_name = u"Fixed Name"
   >>> flac1.update_metadata(m)

   and case 4 becomes:

   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.streaminfo.md5sum = fixed_md5sum
   >>> flac1.update_metadata(m)

   while the other cases remain unchanged.

*** DONE Handle bitstream closing more consistently
    The basic handle cycle is:

    h = open_handle(substream); /*allocates space for handle*/
    h->method(h);               /*performs reads/writes on handle*/
    ...
    h->close(h);                /*closes substream and deallocates handle*/

    But we also need two additional methods
    for working with the handle and its substream seperately.

    | method            | substream      | handle      |
    |-------------------+----------------+-------------|
    | close()           | flushed/closed | deallocated |
    | close_substream() | flushed/closed | nothing     |
    | free()            | nothing        | deallocated |
    |-------------------+----------------+-------------|

    This is especially important for the Python wrappers
    in which closing and dealloacting will come from different routines.

** TODO Integrate MusicBrainz/FreeDB lookup with cd2track/dvda2track
   The two step extraction process is a relic from when I'd do
   batch lookups via modem.
   Combining metadata querying with extraction lets me perform more
   powerful lookups than are possible by using XMCD/XML file intermediaries.

   However, CD lookups may be still be wrong.
   Therefore, it's essential to have a simple, interactive
   track metadata editor so that this data is very easy to populate.
*** DONE Add multi-track interactive editing mode to tracktag
**** DONE Update man page
*** DONE Build unified metadata selection widget for interactive modes
    This is something that can be run while a disc is being extracted
    or a track is being split which will drop the user back
    into a progress indicator once completed and then
    tag/rename the resulting tracks.
*** DONE Add MusicBrainz/FreeDB lookup options to audiotools-config
    It should be possible to decide whether to query either or both
    as a config option.
*** DONE Query MusicBrainz for album_number/album_total info
    Given a particular disc ID, there must be some way to pull
    the disc's album_number/album_total off MusicBrainz's servers
    if it's one of a series of discs.
*** DONE Add pre-extraction metadata lookup to tracksplit
**** DONE Update man page
*** DONE Add pre-extraction metadata lookup to cd2track
**** DONE Update man page with new options
*** DONE Add pre-extraction metadata lookup to dvda2track
**** DONE Update man page with new options
*** DONE Update cdinfo to use new ID calculation routines
    Ensure they handle the FreeDB test disc properly.
*** DONE Add pre-play metadata lookup to cdplay
**** DONE Update man page
*** DONE Add album-number/album-total options to tracksplit
    Allow these values to be populated at split-time
    if none can be found in metadata services
**** DONE Update man page
*** DONE Update album-number/album-total options in cd2track
*** DONE Remove xmcd-specific options
    Automatic CD lookup should be folded into utilites as needed.

*** TODO Update unit tests
*** TODO Deprecate xmcd-specific modules
    Since metadata lookup handles files internally,
    there's no need for metadata file handling classes/functions
    at the Python level.
**** TODO Update documentation to indicate deprecation

   That is, anything larger than a .wav can typically handle
