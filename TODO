* Previous Issues
** DONE Fix WAVE/MP3 formats to support MP3 audio in a WAVE container
   Instead of WaveAudio generating a nasty "compression not supported" error,
   its is_type() classmethod should return False.
   And, MP3Audio's is_type() classmethod should check for MP3 compressed
   RIFF WAVE containers.
   This isn't likely to mess up decoding, but may confuse ID3 tagging.
** DONE Allow file template to be specified on the command line
   When making new files with track2track, cd2track, etc.
** DONE Update the website with the latest documentation
** DONE Allow a unified %(album_track_number)s file template field
   If there's no album number, it's simply 2 digits of track number.
   Otherwise, it's a combination of the two fields.
   For example, album_number = 2 and track_number = 13 results in
   "213" for a value.
** DONE Update trackcat to take a cuesheet argument when outputting FLACs
   Thus, one can perform:
   trackcat --cuesheet=file.cue file1.wav file2.wav file3.wav -t flac -o cd.flac
   which will embed "file.cue" into "cd.flac" using metaflac.
   Though no other format I'm aware of supports this kind of cuesheet handling,
   being able to easily build solid disc images of a single FLAC file
   is much of the reason for trackcat/tracksplit.
** DONE Don't remove undone tracklint entries from its undo DB
   Since its checksum will change anyway and no longer match,
   explicitly removing the entry is no longer necessary
** DONE Support FLAC padding
   If changes to FLAC metadata are small enough, write over the
   padding (if present) rather than rewrite the whole file - like metaflac.
   This approach should speed up tagging considerably.
** DONE Fix image support in ID3v2
   Very large images can take a very long time to load.
** DONE Fix programs to key on album number and track number
   Certain programs, such as trackcmp, work on tracks across two directories
   and key on track number to determine which to compare to which.
   These need to be updated to use both track number and album number.
** DONE Adjust wave conversions to use album number, if present
   For example, converting track_number 15 and album_number 2 to WAVE
   should make a file "track215.cdda.wav" which then properly converts
   back to track_number 15 and album_number 2 if read.
** DONE Improve XMCD handling
   Support for XMCD files often breaks down if one or more tracks
   are missing.
   In some cases, there's no fix to be had (track2xmcd)
   but in most instances it should be made to work correctly.
** DONE Perform type inference wherever possible
   Anything with a single output file (trackcat and record2track)
   should be able to infer its output type from the track suffix, if possible.
** DONE Add "comment" field support to all metadata types
   Don't forget to add unit tests for comment field.
*** TODO Sort "comment" fields correctly across all metadata types
*** TODO Add --comment support to tracktag
** DONE Fix ID3v2 image support to handle Unicode descriptions
   The current implementation falls down on UTF-16 input,
   but I should have a solution from the COMM frame handler.
** DONE Limit ID3v2.2/2.3 to UCS-2 encoding
   The current implementation treats UCS-2 the same as UTF-16.
   This needs to be fixed so that really high unicode characters
   (above U+FFFF) are replaced with something within spec.
** DONE Unify ID3v2 frame handling
   In the beginning, there were text frames and Everything Else.
   Text frames were unicode strings,
   and Everything Else was a binary string of whatever.
   Now that ID3 is cluttered with APIC frames and COMM frames that need
   special treatment, ID3v2 needs an overhaul to more resemble FlacMetaData.
*** DONE Ensure unknown frames are displayed correctly
    Anything that's not text, images or comments should get some sort
    of proper display instead of a Python object string.
** DONE Add app testing to the unit test suite
   Though not everything is unit-testable
   (such as the CD handling programs or anything X11)
   a lot of the batch programs are to some degree:
- [X] coverdump
- [X] track2track
- [X] trackcat
- [X] trackcmp
- [X] tracklength
- [X] tracklint
- [X] trackrename
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] tracktag
** DONE Add verbosity levels to programs
   Every batch program should support a -V --verbose flag
   with options for "silence","normal" (the default) and "debug".
   Silence shuts off everything but error messages.
   Normal is standard output behavior.
   Debug for additional debugging output.
- [X] cd2track
- [X] cd2xmcd
- [X] coverdump
- [X] record2track
- [X] track2cd (this will need to forward verbosity to cdrecord)
- [X] track2track
- [X] track2xmcd
- [X] trackcmp
- [X] trackrename
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] tracktag
- [X] tracklint
** DONE Add compression percentage display to trackinfo
   Though not massively useful, it'd be neat to see just how
   compressed audio tracks are, as a percentage of their original size.
** DONE Add support for W??? frames to ID3v2
   The various W??? frames are really just URLs and don't need to
   be displayed as hex-encoded blobs.
** DONE Add CUE/TOC support to track2cd
   It should be possible to burn a selection of tracks, or a disc image,
   from a cuesheet with all its indexes/ISRC/catalog data intact
   by passing --cue to track2cd.
** DONE Unify CUE/TOC support
   Cuesheets and cdrdao TOC files are largely interchangeable.
   They both feature a listing of track offsets and, optionally,
   CD-TEXT data, ISRCs and so on.
   These formats should be unified such that any program will
   handle them both automatically.
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] trackcat
- [X] tracktag
*** DONE Update docs to mention CUE/TOC interchangeability
- [X] tracksplit
- [X] trackcat
- [X] tracktag
*** DONE Support cuesheet from FlacMetaData directly
    Since we're parsing CUE/TOC files anyway, this data can be used
    to build FLAC CUESHEET blocks directly instead of punting
    this task to metaflac.
*** DONE Add unit tests for TOC/CUE files, as well as embedded FLAC cuesheets
** DONE Update copyright text for 2009
** DONE Preserve metadata when using trackcat
   Any fields shared by all tracks should be merged into metadata
   for the newly combined track.
** DONE Don't route data though WAVE files unless necessary
   Currently, track2track routes through WAVE if both ends happen to
   support foreign RIFF chunks, whether the files have such chunks or not.
   This behavior needs to be modified such that only source files
   which actually have foreign chunks, and a target format that supports them,
   results in a pass through RIFF WAVE.
** DONE Convert editxmcd to PyGTK
   Although the dialog(1)-based version works in terminals and is curses-based,
   it's extremely hokey, error-prone and doesn't support any cut & paste.
   This needs to be reimplemented in PyGTK (since coverview already uses it)
   and made into a stable app someone would want to use.
*** DONE Update XMCD support
    The current handling of XMCD files treats them only as very primative
    AlbumMetaData implementations.  This must be updated into something
    round-trippable if editxmcd is to be modernized.
**** DONE Add XMCD unit tests
**** DONE Update XMCD API documentation
** DONE Require Python 2.5
   Since Python 2.4 is in bugfix-only mode and barely supported,
   it's best to move the minimum version to Python 2.5 or better
   (which has already been superceded by Python 2.6).
   This reduces the amount of Python versions to test on
   and allows the use of more modern Python features which
   makes the code less clunky.
*** TODO Update documentation to mention Python 2.5 requirement.
** DONE Expand WavPack's APEv2 tag coverage
   WavPack's official specification defines APEv2 tags such as
   "Cuesheet" and "Cover Art" which the APEv2 standard does not.
   It would be helpful to make WavPack's APEv2 tags a superset of regular APEv2.
*** DONE Add image support to WavePackAPEv2
*** DONE Add cuesheet support to WavePackAPEv2
** DONE Build unified cuesheet interface
   Once both FLAC and WavPack support embedded cuesheets,
   there will need to be a unified interface to support them.
   I expect this will be a simple pair of get_cuesheet/set_cuesheet
   methods, probably attached to the AudioFiles themselves
   rather than to MetaData objects.
*** DONE Alter FLAC-specific cuesheet documentation to be more general
*** DONE Ensure cuesheets are transferred properly when transcoding
*** DONE Update trackcat to use the interface
*** DONE Update tracksplit to use the interface
*** DONE Update track2cd to use the interface
*** DONE Document cuesheet interface
*** DONE Add unit tests for embedded cuesheets across all formats
*** DONE Add cuesheet import option to tracktag
    This can also use the --cue flag,
    for consistency with other image-handling programs like tracksplit.
    If given with a single, album-length track, --cue will import a cuesheet.
    If given with multiple tracks or a single track that's too short,
    --cue will function like --xmcd and act as a metadata source.
*** DONE Update track2xmcd to support getting an XMCD file from CD image
** DONE Convert to Muspack SV8
   Now that Musepack SV8 is finalized, it should be the new default.
   The old SV7 command-line tools aren't well supported and don't
   seem to work outside of x86 platforms.
   SV7 streams are, in theory, backwards compatible so switching
   shouldn't be a problem.
** DONE Update coverview to look more standard
   It's currently a haphazard assortment of widgets
   rather than anything like a proper GTK app.
   It should be tweaked to look better.
** DONE Improve transcoding robustness
   Just about all of the to_pcm() and from_pcm() methods expect
   that their subprocess calls will work as expected.
   Though rare in practice, these need to be checked in case
   the child processes fail for any reason.
*** DONE Check for invalid input/output files/permissions errors
    If an output file can't be read/written to for some reason
    (invalid permissions, etc.) generate a proper error message
    instead of throwing ugly IOExceptions or confusing errors.

** DONE Make text output consistent
   Currently, command-line programs generate output using a
   selection of scattered print statements - often accompanied by
   if blocks when verbosity is indicated - and haphazardly
   filtered through unicode.
   This should be replaced by a unified message system similar
   to Python's built-in logging module which can abstract away
   these difficulties.
*** DONE Convert tty output to gettext-based strings
    This will not only make output messages more consistent across the tools,
    but will also allow for foreign language translations in the future.

*** DONE Add unit tests for tty output
    All programs which generate output should be unit tested
    so that all code paths are assured of printing the messages they're
    supposed to print, at the streams they're supposed to print on,
    and in the proper encoding settings.

*** DONE Add unit tests
*** DONE Add fields to --format output
*** DONE Update man pages with fields information
** DONE Integrate better MetaData merging
   There's a few areas in which MetaData from multiple sources must
   be merged in an intelligent manner,
   such as where tracksplit takes a source track an XMCD file.
   Now that a preliminary MetaData.merge() classmethod is in place,
   this process must be integrated consistently.

** DONE Improve M4A metadata handling
*** DONE Make M4A metadata updating less destructive
   Like FLAC, not all fields need to be wiped out when overwriting
   old metadata with new.
*** DONE Add more M4A-specific unit tests
** DONE Add more system information to audiotools-config
   All BIN-referenced binaries should be accounted for.
   Thumbnailing status and requirements should be shown.
** DONE Add cdinfo utility
   Analagous to trackinfo, but for an inserted CD.
   This would be a better location for cd2xmcd's "-i" option.
*** DONE Add cdinfo man page
*** DONE Link cdinfo man page to other utility man pages
** DONE Add manual page for audiotools.cfg
   It'll be easier to check what the options are from a man page
   rather than having to check the website or PDF doc.
** DONE Convert vorbiscomment dependency to Python
   This would remove the last app-based MetaData-setting utility
   and may pave the way for adding cover art to Ogg Vorbis
   (assuming I can find the standard for a secondary stream of image data)
** DONE Add metadata deletion capability
   It would be helpful to have the low-level capability of deleting
   either part of a MetaData tag or the entire tag altogether.
   For example, deleting the "track_name" field would delete
   a Vorbis comment's "TITLE" field.
   Or, deleting the MetaData from MP3 would remove all the ID3v2/ID3v1 tags.
*** DONE Add delattr to ID3v1
** DONE Integrate pyconstruct as a submodule
** DONE Add undo capability to editxmcd
** DONE Add --cue option to track2xmcd
   One should be able to pull metadata from CD images
   without having to embed the cuesheet.
*** DONE Add unit tests for track2xmcd's --cue option
*** DONE Update man page
** DONE Group --help output more intelligently
   For tools with a large number of options (such as track2track or tracktag)
   the --help output is particularly jumbled.
   Use more of optparse's features to make this output clearer.

** DONE Check for FLAC metadata chunk overflow
   Although APEv2 and ID3 tags support very large objects (hundreds of MB),
   FLAC metadata chunks have a maxmimum of about 16MB per chunk,
   which may be hit accidentally.
** DONE Fix or replace Python's built-in aifc module
   The current implementation suffers from bugs.
*** DONE Document AIFF better
** DONE Add MusicBrainz support
   It would be helpful to have external metadata support beyond FreeDB,
   since FreeDB is very primitive.
*** DONE Ensure that MusicBrainz is interchangeable with FreeDB/XMCD
**** DONE Unify track2xmcd/track2mb, cd2xmcd/cd2mb
     Based on preliminary testing, MusicBrainz's output is better than FreeDB's
     but its album coverage is not as broad.
     In addition, nobody wants to run their albums through two separate tools
     in order to extract metadata for tagging.  The best solution is
     for tools to try both and output the one that's most complete.
**** DONE Extend editxmcd to MusicBrainz XML
     Although editxmcd was originally designed specifically for XMCD files
     and MusicBrainz's XML format differs radically, no one should have to
     know whether an album metadata file is one or the other.
     Therefore, editxmcd should be extended with additional fields
     to handle XML backend data if necessary.
**** DONE Handle multiple Release entries with single Disc ID
**** DONE Allow MusicBrainz XML output for new editxmcd files
     FreeDB output should also be an option, however.
*** DONE Add MusicBrainz protocol/format documentation

*** DONE Update documentation with MusicBrainz config file fields
*** DONE Ensure missing XML fields are handled correctly
    The MusicBrainz XML spec allows most fields to be missing altogether
    (such as <title>).  editxmcd should add these fields in the proper place
    if necessary.
**** DONE Add unit tests for improperly reordered XML fields
** DONE Ensure .glade files are found
   Not all systems place Python data files in the same locations.
** DONE Convert to_pcm()/from_pcm() to FrameList-based I/O
   Passing specifically-sized blobs of binary data between conversion
   routines worked well when those routines are little more than
   subprocess black-boxes.  However, this approach works less well
   whenever actual sample values are required, or when processing is needed.
   In those cases, going from integers to strings, converting the strings
   back to integers for processing, then bouncing them into strings once
   again becomes needless work.
   A more sensible approach is to keep all data as FrameList-compatible
   objects (stored as C-based lists of int32s behind-the-scenes)
   and convert that data to/from strings only at the beginning and end
   of processing.
*** DONE Build C-based audiotools.pcm.FrameList object
    This needs to closely match audiotools.FrameList's functionality
    and combine all the PCM conversion features from audiotools.pcmreader
**** DONE Integrate audiotools.pcm.FrameList with i_array structures
**** DONE Make audiotools.pcm.FrameList into a standalone object
     So standalone test codecs can use them, such as "flacenc"

*** DONE Ensure integrated FrameList passes all unit tests
*** DONE Remove deprecated audiotools.FrameList object
*** DONE Remove deprecated pcmstream.PCMStreamReader object

    Other C libraries often import audiotools.pcm via Python callbacks
    This library importing should be cached when possible.

*** DONE Make pcm objects self-documenting
    For example, their methods and functions should give useful info
    when checked with "help()"
** DONE Add native ReplayGain handling routines
*** DONE Add native ReplayGain handling to FlacAudio/OggFlacAudio
*** DONE Ensure add_replay_gain()'s exceptions are caught
    Errors during calculation may raise ValueError,
    which must be caught anywhere the function is called
*** DONE Add ReplayGain unit tests
*** DONE Ensure ReplayGain works properly on 8bps and 24bps output
*** DONE Ensure ReplayGain is applied consistently
    Although cd2track and tracksplit are guaranteed
    to generate only one album at a time, track2track and tracktag are not.
    If multiple albums are applied gain at once,
    add_replay_gain must be called on an album-by-album basis
    rather than on the entire set.
*** DONE Double-check ReplayGainReader
    Ensure its output is consistent with other implementations.
** DONE Fix multi-channel audio handling
   It's important that channel mapping information be preserved
   when transcoding between sources with 3+ channels.
   This likely means another flag for PCMReader so that
   from_pcm() can build a file with the proper channel mask set.
   However, it may also be necessary to build some sort of
   channel reordering mechanism in the event that formats differ
   on how channels are to be ordered in the file.
*** Channel Counts and Ordering
| Format     | Maximum Channels | Ordering               |

*** DONE Unit test multichannel encoding and channel_mask handling
**** DONE Ensure all AudioFile types have a working channel_mask() method
     Even 2 channel audio should yield something valid.
**** DONE Ensure all to_pcm() methods yield a matching channel_mask attribute
**** DONE Ensure channel_mask is preserved between from_pcm(to_pcm()) calls
**** DONE Ensure channel_mask is preserved between to_wave()/from_wave() calls
**** DONE Ensure channels are actually stored in the proper order
     This is less of an issue for .wav, .flac, .oga or .wv
     which already store channels in RIFF WAVE order
     and more of an issue for Ogg Vorbis and other formats that do not.
**** DONE Ensure UnsupportedChannelMask is raised when necessary
     This includes calls to from_pcm() and from_wave()
*** DONE Ensure PCMReader.channel_mask is always an integer
** DONE Fix the unit test error messages
** DONE Make the programming documentation web-capable
    It should render consistently with the regular Python reference docs
    and be placed both in the source tree and on the website
    for better accessability.

   For example, track 2 of 7, album 5 of 11 in format
   "%(album_track_number)s - %(track_name)s.%(suffix)s should be:
   "0502 - name.suffix"
** DONE editxmcd's "New" command should work with embedded cuesheets
   Selecting a single disc image with embedded cuesheets should
   fill in the proper XMCD/MusicBrainz fields
** DONE Ensure add_replay_gain used on hi-def tracks doesn't raise errors
** DONE Add Shorten support
   I don't expect people have a lot of shn files lying around
   and nobody should be using it for new data
   (though I'll add a rudimentary encoder for completeness' sake)
   but it's interesting to document for historical reasons.

*** DONE update manual page to cover new behavior
** DONE Add analyzers for built-in decoders
   Analagous to flac(1)'s --analyze option,
   this will be an .analyze_frame() method that returns a Python dict
   of ints/lists/dicts containing frame data on each pass,
   or None at the stream's end.
   This will provide both an easier way to visualize the file's internals,
   and also a debugging aid.
*** DONE FlacDecoder
*** DONE SHNDecoder
*** DONE ALACDecoder
** DONE Add more examples
   A lot of handy new features aren't documented with examples and walkthroughs.
   Examples to add include:
- [X] a full multi-CD example, detailing the use of --album-number
- [X] an image embedding walkthrough
- [X] a CD image creation, splitting, burning example involving TOC/CUE files
- [X] an XMCD walkthrough with fetching, editing and tagging

** DONE Ensure man pages install correctly on Mac OS X
** DONE add a %(basename)s --format attribute
   For example, given the path: "/foo/bar/01 - track name.mp3"
   the %(basename)s attribute would be: "01 - track name"
   allowing one to ignore its internal metadata entirely
   and use original names.

    - [X] audiotools.cfg.5
*** DONE Add unit test support for new attribute
*** DONE Add documentation for new field to programming reference
*** DONE Add documentation for format strings to programming reference
** DONE Update AudioFile.track_name classmethod
   the previous behavior was a kludge cobbled together over time
   Its new call method is:  track_name(file_path, metadata, format)
   so that track_number and album_number can be pulled from file_path
   directly instead of passed in from outside.
*** DONE Update tools to support new calling method
    - [X] track2track

*** DONE Update programming documentation
*** DONE Add unit tests
*** DONE Update old unit tests with new behavior
*** DONE unit test suffix field
** DONE Update Python code to support PEP 8
   Following accepted Python style should make the code more
   accessible and maintainable in the long run.
   It's also a good opportunity to clean up and simplify code
   without changing the actual API interface.

    Since most metadata formats make use of padding,
    we can use a simple XOR over their contents to generate
    a bidirectional patch that's optimized for tracklint's behavior.
    Since the bulk of such a patch should be NULLs,
    we can compress it with zlib/bz2 and achieve
    excellent compression.

** DONE indicate ReplayGain capabilities/binaries
   audiotools-config(1) should show what ReplayGain binaries are present
   and all audio classes that support it
** DONE update trackcmp to share trackverify's output interface
** DONE Add unary jump tables with a max value
   Since both Apple Lossless *and* WavPack have unary reading
   with a maximum upper limit of read bits, it makes sense
   to build a proper jump table for it.
   The size of our state limits the maximum to 8 bits,
   so larger maximums will be supported at a read_limited_unary() level.

   The trouble is, we need to differentiate between normal exits
   (we've hit the stop bit) and exits that hit the maximum value.
   So, the jump table itself must have a different syntax
   (probably an extra bit for "maximum value reached")
   and read_limited_unary() will likely return -1 in that event.

    function to the bitstream writer itself.

** DONE Update ALAC to handle multichannel audio
   What David Hammerton's reverse-engineered decoder described as
   a 3-bit frame footer isn't; it's actually a "stop" delimiter
   analagous to WavPack's block header stop bit.
   If it's not 0x7, keep reading frames and combine them
   channel-wise into a single multichannel chunk of output.

   iTunes and iPods still won't be able to handle such files,
   but XLD should be able to.

   Which would perform the proper to_pcm()/from_pcm()/to_wave()/from_wave()
   calls as necessary and could be overloaded to handle specific
   conversion processes, like AIFF->Shorten with a different set of
   IFF chunks.

*** DONE Convert i_array size and data types to typedefs
*** DONE Convert f_array size and data types to typedefs
*** DONE Add more comprehensive encoding documentation
*** DONE Add a variety of assert() statements
    As with unit tests, these ensure everything is working during testing
    without a performance penalty at runtime.
*** DONE Handle foreign RIFF chunks
*** DONE Ensure FLACs work on a variety of other decoders
    Although decoding properly on the reference decoder *should* guarantee
    the file works everywhere, the only way to be certain is to test it.
*** DONE Ensure encoder raises the proper exceptions
*** DONE Support Rice2 partitions?
    The reference encoder uses these for more efficient handling of 24-bit audio
    but I'm not sure they're strictly necessary for my more basic encoder.
*** DONE Support wasted-bits-per-sample?
    I don't think I've ever seen these used on actual audio data
    that isn't artificial and hasn't been processed specifically for its use.
    As with Rice2, it's something that may get added later.
*** DONE Handle multi-channel PCM data correctly
    Anything higher than 2 channels needs to set a channel mask
    and the vorbis comment to the proper value.
    I expect this will be a long-term project
    coinciding with re-engineering the to_pcm()/from_pcm() methods.

*** DONE Handle empty MD5 sums correctly
    If the MD5SUM is 00000000000000000000000000000000
    it's never a mismatch and should not trigger an error.

***** DONE Ensure an empty MD5 doesn't trigger an error at verify time
***** DONE Ensure tracklint populates an empty MD5 correctly
** DONE Add substream support to bitstream reader
   Its function is to allow one to pull pieces out of a larger bitstream
   and process them separately.
   For example, while parsing an Ogg stream's pages with one bitstream,
   the extracted Vorbis packets could be processed with smaller substreams -
   including substreams that span one or more pages.
   It's also potentially helpful for MP3, Ogg FLAC, DVD-A and any other format
   with nontrivial wrappers that need to be parsed seperately
   from the main bitstream.

    It should be possible to create a substream, process it partway,

** DONE Eliminate the MetaData.merge() method
   The idea of this method is to provide some sort of precedence
   which combining metadata from two sources.
   For example, in track2track, we want provided XMCD metadata
   to override metadata inside the track itself.
   The .merge() method takes a raw MetaData object from XMCD
   and merges it with non-blank fields from the original file
   which means the XMCD metadata is the "base" of sorts.

   A cleaner approach would be to take the raw MetaData object from XMCD,
   get a list of its non-empty fields and call __setattr__ on
   the track's metadata to update those fields.

   MetaData with the highest priority would call __setattr__ last.

   Something like:

   array = new_int_array();
   array->append(array, value);
   array->del(array);

   which always functions the same whether we're dealing with ints or
   floats or other arrays, yet is still type-checked at compile-time.

** DONE Integrate MusicBrainz/FreeDB lookup with cd2track/dvda2track
   The two step extraction process is a relic from when I'd do
   batch lookups via modem.
   Combining metadata querying with extraction lets me perform more
   powerful lookups than are possible by using XMCD/XML file intermediaries.

   However, CD lookups may be still be wrong.
   Therefore, it's essential to have a simple, interactive
   track metadata editor so that this data is very easy to populate.
*** DONE Add multi-track interactive editing mode to tracktag
**** DONE Update man page
*** DONE Build unified metadata selection widget for interactive modes
    This is something that can be run while a disc is being extracted
    or a track is being split which will drop the user back
    into a progress indicator once completed and then
    tag/rename the resulting tracks.
*** DONE Add MusicBrainz/FreeDB lookup options to audiotools-config
    It should be possible to decide whether to query either or both
    as a config option.
*** DONE Query MusicBrainz for album_number/album_total info
    Given a particular disc ID, there must be some way to pull
    the disc's album_number/album_total off MusicBrainz's servers
    if it's one of a series of discs.

*** DONE Handle bitstream closing more consistently
    The basic handle cycle is:

    h = open_handle(substream); /*allocates space for handle*/
    h->method(h);               /*performs reads/writes on handle*/
    ...
    h->close(h);                /*closes substream and deallocates handle*/

    But we also need two additional methods
    for working with the handle and its substream seperately.

    | method            | substream      | handle      |
    |-------------------+----------------+-------------|
    | close()           | flushed/closed | deallocated |
    | close_substream() | flushed/closed | nothing     |
    | free()            | nothing        | deallocated |
    |-------------------+----------------+-------------|

    This is especially important for the Python wrappers
    in which closing and dealloacting will come from different routines.

    the bitstream should set I/O functions to error generators
    and further closes should do nothing.
**** DONE Add unit test to bitstream.c
**** DONE Add unit test to Python side
** DONE Add update_metadata() method to AudioFile
   Consider how AudioFile.set_metadata() handles six different cases:

   Case 1: adjusting a file's own textual metadata (tracktag)
   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.track_name = u"Fixed Name"
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(m)

   Case 2: transferring metadata from the same audio type (track2track)
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(flac2.get_metadata())

   Case 3: transferring metadata from a different audio type (track2track)
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(mp3.get_metadata())

   Case 4: adjusting a file's own low-level metadata (tracklint)
   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.streaminfo.md5sum = fixed_md5sum
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(m)

   Case 5: building new metadata from scratch (cd2track)
   >>> flac1 = FlacAudio.from_pcm(pcm_reader)
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(MetaData(track_name=u"New Name", ...))

   Case 6: transferring adjusted metadata from the same audio type
   >>> m = flac2.get_metadata()
   >>> m.track_name = u"Adjusted Name"
   >>> flac1.set_metadata(m)

   What happens to stuff like the STREAMINFO block
   which contains track length, md5sum, etc.
   and is part of FLAC's metadata?

   If set_metadata() works naively and doesn't override any values,
   case 2 breaks since flac1 suddenly has flac2's track length.

   If set_metadata() overrides new metadata with stuff from the current file,
   case 4 breaks since the fixed_md5sum gets overridden.

   Counting on set_metadata() being smart enough to know what you mean
   is a losing proposition for FLAC, M4A and other metadata formats
   with embedded non-textual (side) metadata.

   One solution is to add a low-level AudioFile.update_metadata() method
   which takes only the AudioFile's required metadata type
   and leaves side data as-is.  So case 1 becomes:

   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.track_name = u"Fixed Name"
   >>> flac1.update_metadata(m)

   and case 4 becomes:

   >>> m = flac1.get_metadata()
   >>> m.streaminfo.md5sum = fixed_md5sum
   >>> flac1.update_metadata(m)

   while the other cases remain unchanged.

** DONE Reduce load from progress updating routines
   Send fewer progress updates from child to parent
   when performing progress-based tasks.

   This is harder than it sounds.

   In an ideal world, I'd have the parent poll its children
   on a regular basis and update the progress bars
   and/or start more children.

   In practice, this doesn't work with subprocesses and shared memory
   because shared memory accumulators don't free themselves correctly
   when working with more than one child process.

   It works even less well with threading because subprocess.Popen
   isn't thread-safe and will certainly deadlock if called often enough.

   So although the current system is clunky and inefficient
   at least it works.

    with header/footers included and paper size populated.

    It's better to use Python for that trivial templating instead.

** DONE Add optional interactive modes to utilities
   Now that Urwid is being used for editxmcd, it might be helpful
   to add optional console-based interactive modes to the other tools.
   This may improve ease-of-use (particularly discoverability
   in the case of format and quality options) without sacrificing
   scriptability or command-line power.

   Just as the command-line options are kept as consistent as possible,
   all interactive modes will also need a consistent interface.

   track2track may handle multiple albums simultaneously
   and currently makes mutiple calls to urwid to work.
   A better approach is to have all the metadata lookups
   performed first, multiple metadata edit screens,
   and a single output options/preview screen.
** DONE Simplify PCMReaderWindow
   Split this into a PCMReaderHead and PCMReaderDeHead pair.

   The former handles the "pcm_frames" argument,

* TODO Ensure non-image cuesheets are handled properly
  There are 4 different types of cuesheets,
  1 single file type and 3 different multiple file variants.
  We should be able to translate between them if necessary, and if possible.
* TODO Add support for genre tag?
  I'm not a big fan of the genre tag.
  Unlike track number, album name, ISRC, etc. in which a value
  can be reliably determined from the source material (e.g. back of the CD),
  genre is akin to a "rating" tag. Its value varies from person to person
  and this makes it less valuable for archival purposes.

  In addition, the genre tag itself is implemented in incompatible ways.
  APEv2 uses a chunk of text, ID3v1 uses an integer representing one
  of many designated genre labels, ID3v2 uses a mix of genre byte
  and/or text string, and so on.

  That said, the genre field shows up in a lot of players.
  So, some grudging support for it would probably be appreciated.
* TODO Convert TOC and CUE handling to proper grammars
  Although the current ad-hoc method works in most cases,
  it would be better to use a more formal method to parse these files
  which can be proven to handle all legal files.
  I expect this will require PLY or some similar lexx/yacc mechanism
  which I'll bundle to avoid adding any extra depencies.
* TODO Replace magic numbers with named constants
  There's still a few instances of magic numbers in use,
  in the __flac__.py module, for instance.
* TODO Support disc metadata submission
  If a disc is not found on FreeDB or MusicBrainz,
  there should be some mechanism to submit user-defined data
  to those services.

  online cover databases and retrieve images for tagging purposes.
  track2cover can replace coverdump, functioning like trac2xmcd
  which allows it to pull from existing metadata or from online sources.
* TODO build trackverify utility
  Much like flac(1)'s --verify option, this should check
  a file for correctness and, if possible, verify its output
  matches any internal hashes/checksums.
  May work recursively to check a user's entire collection.
** DONE add a .verify() method to AudioFile classes
   Returns True if the file is okay.  Raises InvalidFile if not.
   Include unit test.

     MLP decoding supports 1 or 2 substreams.
     In some cases, substream 1 will contain the first 2 channels

     which provides two different "mixes" depending on whether
     one is decoding to 2 channels or not.

* TODO Handle write errors more gracefully
  Just as the BitstreamReader uses an exception mechanism to detect
  and handle read errors, the BitstreamWriter should use a similar
  mechanism to detect write errors and bubble-up a Python exception.

  The problem is that invalid writes are difficult to unit test.
  With a reader, one can simply truncate a valid file.
  It's harder to constrict a writer to only have X number of bytes
  available so that any errors can be checked.
** TODO Add try/etry support to BitstreamWriter
** DONE Update BitstreamWriter methods to raise exceptions
** TODO Update Python-based BitstreamWriter to catch C exceptions
** TODO Update encoders to catch C exceptions and raise Python exceptions

* TODO Add lyrics metadata support
  Supporting storing lyrics text in the audio files themselves
  would be quite useful.
** TODO Add .lyrics field to MetaData
   Analagous to the lengthy .comment field, most likely.
** TODO Add unit testing for .lyrics field
** TODO Find automated source for lyrics
   Analagous to CDDB.
   This will be challenging since online sources for lyrics are rare.
   Unfortunately, expecting everyone to transcribe lyrics for songs
   is unrealistic - even moreso than filling in song names
   or scanning in covers by hand.
   If it's too much work, there's little point in having it.
** TODO Add tool support for lyrics
** TODO Add unit testing to tools
* TODO Convert format reference to HTML
  Not only would it be more accessible,
  but I could better integrate examples and give it basic interactivity.
  All of the diagrams and formulas must be kept as vector art
  so that they'll remain crisp when scaled.

  Unfortunately, Chrome doesn't do MathML and IE doesn't do SVG
  which makes it non-viable right now.

*** DONE Update documentation
*** DONE Update utilities
**** DONE tracksplit
     If the file being split isn't seekable, decompress it to a temp file
     so it can be processed across multiple jobs.
**** DONE trackcmp
     If comparing multiple tracks against a non-seekable image,
     decompress it to a temp file so it can be processed across multiple jobs.
*** DONE Update unit tests
** TODO Have AccurateRip detect offset tracks
   If the tracks have been ripped accurately but are merely offset
   by some small positive or negative number of samples,
   this should be detected and indicated in the AccurateRip results screens.
*** TODO Update ChecksumV1
**** TODO Add keyword parameters with sensible defaults
**** TODO Add range option
     This indicates the total range of the window size.
     Defaults to 1, indicating only a single checksum to be generated.
**** TODO Change .checksum() method to .checksums()
     Returns a list of all calculated checksums over the whole range.
*** DONE Add unit tests
    Ensure ranged and non-ranged checksums are calculated properly
    and update tests for new interface.
*** TODO Build audiotools.cdio.CDDAReader object
    This functions like a PCMReader object over the entire CDDA device.
    It should work transparently on physical CD devices as well as CD images
    and by PCM-frame centric by doing all the CD sector conversions
    behind-the-scenes.
**** TODO Add methods and attributes
***** DONE CDDAReader.sample_rate
***** DONE CDDAReader.channels
***** DONE CDDAReader.channel_mask
***** DONE CDDAReader.bits_per_sample

*** TODO Update utilities
    When verifying AccurateRip, make sure to populate the checksum
    with the last few samples of the previous track (if any)
    and the next few samples of the next track (if any)
    in order to find the checksum's offset.
**** DONE trackverify
**** TODO cd2track
* TODO Finish version 3.0
** TODO Shift to Python 3
   This lengthy transition will have to wait
   until Python 3 is installed by default on
   common Linux distros and Mac OS.
