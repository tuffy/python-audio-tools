\chapter{Shorten}
Shorten is one of the earliest lossless audio compression formats.
Though superceded by FLAC and other formats, it remains interesting
from a historical perspective.

\section{Shorten data types}
Notably, almost nothing in the Shorten file format is byte-aligned.
Instead, it uses its own set of variable-length types which I'll
refer to as \texttt{unsigned}, \texttt{signed} and \texttt{long}.

\begin{wrapfigure}[16]{r}{2in}
\includegraphics{figures/shorten_unsigned.pdf}
\caption{Unsigned}
\includegraphics{figures/shorten_signed.pdf}
\caption{Signed}
\end{wrapfigure}
An \texttt{unsigned} field of a certain ``size'' means we first
take a unary-encoded\footnote{In this instance, unary-encoding is a simple
matter of counting the number of 0 bits before the next 1 bit.
The resulting sum is the value.}, number of high bits and combine
the resulting value with ``size'' number of low bits.
For example, given a ``size'' of 2 and the bits `\texttt{0 0 1 1 1}',
the high unary value of `\texttt{0 0 1}' combines with the low
raw value of `\texttt{1 1}' resulting in a decimal value of 11.

A \texttt{signed} field is similar, but its low value contains
one additional trailing bit for the sign value.
{\relsize{-2}
\begin{equation*}
\text{signed value} =
\begin{cases}
\text{unsigned value} & \text{if sign bit} = 0 \\
-\text{unsigned value} - 1 & \text{if sign bit} = 1
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
}
For example, given a ``size'' of 3 and the bits `\texttt{0 1 1 0 1 1}',
the high unary value of `\texttt{0 1}' combines with the low
raw value of `\texttt{1 0 1}' and the sign bit `\texttt{1}'
resulting in a decimal value of -14.
Note that the sign bit is counted seperately, so we're
actually reading 4 additional bits after the unary value in this case.

Lastly, and most confusingly, a \texttt{long} field is the combination
of two seperate \texttt{unsigned} fields.
The first, of size 2, determines the size value of the second.
For example, given the bits `\texttt{1 1 1 1 1 0 1}',
the first \texttt{unsigned} field of `\texttt{1 1 1}' has the value
of 3 (unary 0 combined with a raw value of 3) - which is the size
of the next \texttt{unsigned} field.
That field, in turn, consists of the bits `\texttt{1 1 0 1}'
which is 5 (unary 0 combined with a raw value of 5).
So, the value of the entire \texttt{long} field is 5.

A Shorten file consists almost entirely of these three types
in various sizes.
Therefore, when one reads ``\texttt{unsigned(3)}'' in a Shorten field
description, it means an \texttt{unsigned} field of size 3.

``Channels'' is the number of channels in the audio stream.
``Block Length'' is the length of each command block, in samples.
``Max LPC'' is the maximum LPC value a block may have.
``Samples to Wrap'' is the number of samples to be wrapped around
from the top of an output block to the bottom.
This will be explained in more detail in the decoding section.

Internally\marginpar{Interestingly, although
Shorten's successor, FLAC, presents its input as frames and subframes,
references to a FLAC virtual machine are still present in its source code.},
a Shorten file acts as a list of commands to be executed by a tiny
virtual machine.
Each command is a \texttt{unsigned(2)} field followed by zero or more
arguments.

\subsection{the DIFF commands}
All four \texttt{DIFF} commands are structured the same:
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{figures/shorten_diff.pdf}
\end{figure}
\par
\noindent
There are ``Block Size'' number of residuals per \texttt{DIFF}
(whose initial value is determined by the Shorten header)
and each one's size is determined by ``Energy Size''.
The process of transforming these residuals into samples
depends on the \texttt{DIFF} command and the values of
previously decoded samples.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\renewcommand\thefootnote{\thempfootnote}
\begin{tabular}{|c| >{$}l<{$} |}
\hline
Command & \text{Calculation} \\
\hline
\texttt{DIFF0} & Sample_i = Residual_i + Coffset\footnote{See page \pageref{shorten_coffset}} \\
\texttt{DIFF1} & Sample_i = Sample_{i - 1} + Residual_i  \\
\texttt{DIFF2} & Sample_i = (2 \times Sample_{i - 1}) - Sample_{i - 2} + Residual_i \\
\texttt{DIFF3} & Sample_i = (3 \times (Sample_{i - 1} - Sample_{i - 2})) + Sample_{i - 3} + Residual_i \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\par
\noindent
For example, given a \texttt{DIFF1} command at the stream's beginning
and the residual values 10, 1, 2, -2, 1 and -1, samples are
calculated as follows:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|>{$}r<{$}|}
\hline
Index & Residual & \text{Sample} \\
\hline
-1 & (before stream) & \text{(not output) } \bf0 \\
\hline
0 & 10 & 0 + 10 = \bf10 \\
1 & 1 & 10 + 1 = \bf11 \\
2 & 2 & 11 + 2 = \bf13 \\
3 & -2 & 13 - 2 = \bf11 \\
4 & 1 & 11 + 1 = \bf12 \\
5 & -1 & 12 - 1 = \bf11 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\pagebreak

\subsection{Channels and wrapping}
The audio commands \texttt{DIFF}, \texttt{QLPC} and \texttt{ZERO} send
their samples to channels in order.
For example, a stream of \texttt{DIFF} commands in a 2 channel stereo
stream (a very typical configuration) sends $\texttt{DIFF}_1$ to
the left channel, $\texttt{DIFF}_2$ to the right channel,
$\texttt{DIFF}_3$ to left channel, $\texttt{DIFF}_4$ to the right channel
and so on.

However, recall that most of the \texttt{DIFF} commands require
previously decoded samples as part of their calculation.
What this means is that $\texttt{DIFF}_3$ takes the last
few samples from $\texttt{DIFF}_1$ in order to apply its residuals
(since both are on the left channel) and $\texttt{DIFF}_4$
takes the last few samples from $\texttt{DIFF}_2$.

This is where the header's ``Samples to Wrap'' field comes into play.
Its value is the number of samples to be wrapped from the top of the buffer
to its pre-zero values.
For example, if ``Sample Count'' is 256 and ``Samples to Wrap'' is 3
(another typical configuration),
$\text{Buffer}_{-1}$ takes the value of $\text{Buffer}_{255}$,
$\text{Buffer}_{-2}$ takes the value of $\text{Buffer}_{254}$, and
$\text{Buffer}_{-3}$ takes the value of $\text{Buffer}_{253}$.
However, these pre-zero starting-point values are obviously not
re-output when the buffer is finally completed and returned.

\subsection{the QUIT command}

This command takes no arguments.
It indicates the Shorten stream is finished and decoding is completed.

\subsection{the BLOCKSIZE command}

This command takes a single \texttt{long} argument
whose value is the new ``Block Size''.
In effect, it modifies that variable in the Shorten virtual machine.

\subsection{the ZERO command}

This command takes no arguments.
It simply generates ``Block Size'' number of zero samples
into the current channel's output buffer.

\pagebreak

\subsection{the QLPC command}

The \texttt{QLPC} command is structured as follows:

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{figures/shorten_qlpc.pdf}
\end{figure}
\par
\noindent
So, given a set of LPC coefficients and a set of residuals,
samples are calculated using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
Sample_i = \left\lfloor \frac{2 ^ 5 + \overset{Count - 1}{\underset{j = 0}{\sum}}
  \text{LPC Coefficient}_j \times \text{Sample}_{i - j - 1} } {2 ^ 5}\right\rfloor + Residual_i
\end{equation}
This simply means we're taking the sum of the calculated values from
0 to LPC Count - 1, bit-shifting that sum down and added the residual
when determining the current sample.
As with the \texttt{DIFF} commands, previously encoded samples
(possibly from previous commands) are used to calculate the current
sample.

For example, given the LPC Coefficients and previously encoded samples:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{>{$}r<{$} r || >{$}r<{$} r}
\text{LPC Coefficient}_0 & 21 & \text{Sample}_1 & -2 \\
\text{LPC Coefficient}_1 & 2 & \text{Sample}_2 & -3 \\
\text{LPC Coefficient}_2 & 7 & \text{Sample}_3 & -2
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|>{$}r<{$}|}
\hline
Index & Residual & \text{Sample} \\
\hline
1 & & \bf-2 \\
2 & & \bf-3 \\
3 & & \bf-2 \\
\hline
4 & 1 & \left \lfloor \frac{2 ^ 5 + (21 \times -2) + (2 \times -3) + (7 \times -2)}{2 ^ 5} \right \rfloor + 1 = \left \lfloor \frac{32 - 62}{32} \right \rfloor + 1 = -1 + 1 = \bf0 \\
5 & -2 & \left \lfloor \frac{2 ^ 5 + (21 \times \textbf{0}) + (2 \times -2) + (7 \times -3)}{2 ^ 5} \right \rfloor - 2 = \left \lfloor \frac{32 - 25}{32} \right \rfloor - 2 = 0 - 2 = \bf-2 \\
6 & -1 & \left \lfloor \frac{2 ^ 5 + (21 \times \textbf{-2}) + (2 \times \textbf{0}) + (7 \times -2)}{2 ^ 5} \right \rfloor - 1 = \left \lfloor \frac{32 - 56}{32} \right \rfloor - 1 = -1 - 1 = \bf-2 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{figure}
\par
Unfortunately, there's one more wrinkle to consider for proper
\texttt{QLPC} command decoding: the ``coffset''.
How to calculate this value will be covered in the next section.
But when a \texttt{QLPC} command is encountered, the coffset value
is subtracted from the \texttt{QLPC}'s warm-up samples
(taken from the top of the previous command, for the current channel).
Then that coffset value is re-added to our output samples after
calculation.

For example, given a ``coffset'' value of 5, one would subtract 5 from
$\text{Sample}_{-3}$, $\text{Sample}_{-2}$ and $\text{Sample}_{-1}$,
perform the QLPC calculation and then add 5 to our
$\text{Sample}_{0}$, $\text{Sample}_{1}$, $\text{Sample}_{2}$, ... ,
$\text{Sample}_{255}$
before returning those values.

\subsection{the VERBATIM command}

This command is for generating raw, non-audio data such
as .wav or .aiff chunks and is structured as follows:
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{figures/shorten_verbatim.pdf}
\end{figure}
\par
\noindent
These chunks of raw data are expected to be written in the order
they appear in the Shorten file.
