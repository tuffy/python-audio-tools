\chapter{the Basics}

In order to best illustrate how different codecs operate,
this document consists of format diagrams, pseudocode,
and examples.

\section{Format Diagrams}

Format diagrams provide an overview of the format, such as:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics{figures/diagram.pdf}
\end{figure}
\par
\noindent
Each box represents a field, and each field has a name.
In this case, our names are a, b, c, d and e.
Where possible, each field will have a starting bit
in its lower-left corner and an ending bit in its lower-right.
For example, a is comprised of bits 0 and 1, making it a 2-bit value.
The b field uses bits 2 through 4, making it a 3-bit value, and so on.
Variable-length fields such as C-strings may not have starting or ending
bit values.
Fields may also be nested or looped, such as:
\begin{figure}[h]
  \includegraphics{figures/diagram2.pdf}
\end{figure}
\par
\noindent
As a convention, compound fields are named with capital letters
while individual fields use lowercase.
\par
For formats with little or no logic, such as ID3 metadata,
a diagram may be all that's needed for illustration.
However, for more complex codecs, the format diagram serves as a map
which accompanies its pseudocode.
For example, a file format may be composed of many frames, each frame
consists of many subframes, and each subframe consists of many fields.
By placing a diagram alongside the subframe decoding psuedocode,
one can see where you are (a subframe),
where you've been (the enclosing frame)
and where you're going next (the subframe's fields).

\section{Pseudocode}

Pseudocode provides a language-agnostic way of illustrating the flow of logic
required to decode or encode a file format.
These blocks are prefixed by the input expected and the output produced.
One or more operations are performed and something is returned.
For example:
\ALGORITHM{x and y values}{a multiplied value}
\Return $x \times y$\;
\EALGORITHM
\par
\noindent
Any variables not passed into a pseudocode block are created
using the assignment operator, such as:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  $x \leftarrow 1$\;
  $y \leftarrow 2$\;
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
which creates the variables $x$ and $y$ and assigns them the values of 1 and 2.
In C, this would be implemented as:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
int x = 1;
int y = 2;
\end{Verbatim}
Comparisons are performed using the usual math operators
$<$, $\leq$, $=$, $\geq$, $>$.  So:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  $x = y$\;
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
is implemented in C as:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
x == y
\end{Verbatim}
Variables with subscripts are arrays,
which are also created through assignment:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  $a_0 \leftarrow x \times y$\;
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
corresponds to:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
a[0] = x * y;
\end{Verbatim}
Multiple subscripts indicate multi-dimentional arrays:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  $b_{0~1~2} \leftarrow a_0 \times z$\;
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
corresponds to:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
b[0][1][2] = a[0] * z;
\end{Verbatim}

\clearpage

\noindent
Variables are processed using familiar operators such as if/then/else:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  \eIf{$x > y$}{
    $z \leftarrow 1$\;
  }{
    $z \leftarrow 2$\;
  }
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
which correponds to:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
if (x > y) {
  z = 1;
} else {
  z = 2;
}
\end{Verbatim}
while loops:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  \While{$x < y$}{
    $x \leftarrow x \times 2$\;
  }
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
implemented as:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
  while (x < y) {
    x = x * 2;
  }
\end{Verbatim}
and for loops which are inclusive of the first element
but \textit{not} inclusive of the last element.
For example:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  \For{$i \leftarrow 0$ \emph{\KwTo}5}{
    $a_i \leftarrow i \times 2$\;
  }
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
corresponds to:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    a[i] = i * 2;
  }
\end{Verbatim}
whose final result is \texttt{[0, 2, 4, 8]}
\par
\noindent
Downto loops are \textit{not} inclusive of the first element,
but are inclusive of the last:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \SetKw{KwDownTo}{downto}
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  \For{$i \leftarrow 5$ \emph{\KwDownTo}0}{
    $b_i \leftarrow i \times 3$\;
  }
\end{algorithm}
corresponds to:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
  for (i = 5 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    b[i] = i * 3;
  }
\end{Verbatim}

\clearpage

Switch blocks do not imply automatic fallthrough:
\par
\noindent
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \DontPrintSemicolon
  \Switch{$a$}{
    \uCase{0}{
      $b \leftarrow 1$\;
    }
    \uCase{1}{
      $b \leftarrow 2$\;
    }
    \Other{
      $b \leftarrow 100$\;
    }
  }
\end{algorithm}
\par
\noindent
corresponds to:
\begin{Verbatim}[xleftmargin=.25in]
switch (a) {
case 0:
  b = 1;
  break;
case 1:
  b = 2;
  break;
default:
  b = 100;
  break;
}
\end{Verbatim}

%% \section{Hexadecimal}
%% \paragraph
%% In order to understand hexadecimal, it's important to re-familiarize
%% oneself with decimal, which everyone reading this should be familiar with.
%% In ordinary decimal numbers, there are a total of ten characters per digit:
%% 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
%% Because there are ten, we'll call it base-10.
%% So the number 675 is made up of the digits 6, 7 and 5
%% and can be calculated in the following way:
%% \begin{equation*}
%% ( 6 \times 10 ^ 2 ) + ( 7 \times 10 ^ 1 ) + ( 5 \times 10 ^ 0 ) = 675
%% \end{equation*}
%% In hexadecimal, there are sixteen characters per digit:
%% 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.
%% A, B, C, D, E and F correspond to the decimal numbers
%% 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively.
%% Because there are sixteen, we'll call it base-16.
%% So the number 2A3 is made up of the digits 2, A and 3
%% and can be calculated in the following way:
%% \begin{equation*}
%% (2 \times 16 ^ 2 ) + (10 \times 16 ^ 1 ) + (3 \times 16 ^ 0 ) = 675
%% \end{equation*}

%% Why use hexadecimal?
%% The reason brings us back to binary file formats, which are
%% made up of bytes.
%% Each byte is made up of 8 bits and can have a value from 0 to 255,
%% in decimal.
%% Representing a binary file in hexadecimal means a byte requires
%% exactly two digits with values from 0 to FF.
%% That saves us a lot of space versus trying to represent bytes
%% in decimal.

%% Hexadecimal has another important property when dealing with
%% binary data.
%% Because each digit has 16 possible values, each hexadecimal
%% digit represents exactly 4 bits ($16 = 2 ^ 4$).
%% This makes it very easy to go back and forth between hexadecimal
%% and binary.  For instance, let's take the byte 6A:

%% \parpic{\includegraphics{figures/binary.pdf}}

%% \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c || c | c | c |}
%% \hline
%% Hex & Binary & Decimal & Hex & Binary & Decimal \\
%% \hline
%% 0 & 0 0 0 0 & 0 & 8 & 1 0 0 0 & 8 \\
%% 1 & 0 0 0 1 & 1 & 9 & 1 0 0 1 & 9 \\
%% 2 & 0 0 1 0 & 2 & A & 1 0 1 0 & 10 \\
%% 3 & 0 0 1 1 & 3 & B & 1 0 1 1 & 11 \\
%% 4 & 0 1 0 0 & 4 & C & 1 1 0 0 & 12 \\
%% 5 & 0 1 0 1 & 5 & D & 1 1 0 1 & 13 \\
%% 6 & 0 1 1 0 & 6 & E & 1 1 1 0 & 14 \\
%% 7 & 0 1 1 1 & 7 & F & 1 1 1 1 & 15 \\
%% \hline
%% \end{tabular}
%% \begin{flushleft}
%% Going from binary to hexadecimal is a simple matter of reversing
%% the process.
%% \end{flushleft}

%% \section{Signed Integers}
%% \label{signed_ints}
%% Signed integers are typically stored as ``2's-complement'' values.
%% To decode them, one needs to know the integer's size in bits, its
%% topmost (most-significant) bit value and the value of its remaining bits.

%% \begin{equation}
%% \text{signed value} =
%% \begin{cases}
%% \text{remaining bits} & \text{if topmost bit} = 0 \\
%% %%-(2 ^ \text{integer size} - \text{unsigned value} ) & \text{if topmost bit} = 1
%% \text{remaining bits} - (2 ^ {\text{integer size} - 1}) & \text{if topmost bit} = 1
%% \end{cases}
%% \end{equation}
%% For example, take an 8-bit integer whose bit values are \texttt{00000101}.
%% Since the topmost bit is \texttt{0}, its value is simply \texttt{0000101},
%% which is 5 in base-10 ($2 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 0 = 5$).

%% Next, let's take an integer whose bit values are \texttt{11111011}.
%% Its topmost bit is \texttt{1} and its remaining bits are \texttt{1111011},
%% which is 123 in base-10
%% ($2 ^ 6 + 2 ^ 5 + 2 ^ 4 + 2 ^ 3 + 2 ^ 1 + 2 ^ 0 = 123$).
%% Therefore:
%% \begin{align*}
%% \text{signed value} &= 123 - 2 ^ {8 - 1} \\
%%  &= 123 - 128 \\
%%  &= -5
%% \end{align*}

%% Transforming a signed integer into its unsigned 2's-complement value
%% is a simple matter of reversing the process.
%% \begin{equation}
%% \text{unsigned value} =
%% \begin{cases}
%% \text{signed value} & \text{if signed value} \geq 0 \\
%% 2 ^ \text{integer size} - (-\text{signed value}) & \text{if signed value} < 0
%% \end{cases}
%% \end{equation}

%% For example, let's convert the value -20 to a signed, 8-bit integer:
%% \begin{align*}
%% \text{unsigned value} &= 2 ^ 8 - (- -20) \\
%% &= 256 - 20 \\
%% &= 236
%% \end{align*}
%% which is \texttt{11101100} in binary
%% ($2 ^ 7 + 2 ^ 6 + 2 ^ 5 + 2 ^ 3 + 2 ^ 2 = 236$).

%% \pagebreak

%% \section{Endianness}
%% You will need to know about endianness anytime a single value spans
%% multiple bytes.
%% As an example, let's take the first 16 bytes of a small RIFF WAVE file:

%% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
%% 52 49 46 46 54 9b 12 00  57 41 56 45 66 6d 74 20
%% \end{Verbatim}
%% \noindent
%% The first four bytes are the ASCII string `RIFF' (\texttt{0x52 0x49 0x46 0x46}).
%% The next four bytes are a 32-bit unsigned integer which is a size value.
%% Reading from left to right, that value would be \texttt{0x549B1200}.
%% That's almost 1.5 gigabytes.
%% Since this file is nowhere near that large, we're clearly not
%% reading those bytes correctly.

%% The key is that RIFF WAVE files are `little endian'.
%% In plain English, that means we have to read in those bytes
%% from right to left.
%% Thus, the value is actually \texttt{0x00129B54}.
%% That's a little over 1 megabyte, which is closer to our expectations.

%% Remember that little endian reverses the bytes, not the hexadecimal
%% digits.  Simply reversing the string to \texttt{0x0021B945} is not correct.

%% When converting a signed, little-endian value to an integer,
%% the 2's-complement decoding comes \textit{after} one performs
%% the endianness reversing.
%% For example, given a signed 16-bit little-endian value of
%% \texttt{0xFBFF}, one firsts reorders the bytes to \texttt{0xFFFB}
%% before decoding it to a signed value ($32763 - 2 ^ {15} = -5$).

%% Conversely, when converting a signed integer to a little-endian value,
%% the endian reversing comes \textit{after} one performs the
%% 2's-complement encoding.

%% This is covered in more depth in the bitstreams section
%% on page \pageref{bitstreams}.

%% \section{Character Encodings}

%% Many audio formats store metadata, which contains information about
%% the song's name, artist, album and so forth.
%% This information is stored as text, but it's important to know what
%% sort of text in order to read it and display it properly.

%% As an example, take the simple character \texttt{\'e}.
%% In Latin-1 encoding, it is stored as a single byte \texttt{0xE9}.
%% In UTF-8 encoding, it is stored as the bytes \texttt{0xC3A9}.
%% In UTF-16BE encoding, it is stored as the bytes \texttt{0x00E9}.

%% Although decoding and encoding text is a complex subject beyond
%% the scope of this document, you must always be aware that
%% metadata may not be 7-bit ASCII text and should handle
%% it properly in whatever encoding is supported by the metadata
%% formats.
%% Look to your programming tools for libraries to assist in Unicode
%% text handling.

%% \pagebreak

%% \section {PCM}
%% \parpic[r]{\includegraphics{figures/pcm.pdf}}

%% Pulse-Code Modulation is a method for transforming an analog
%% audio signal into a digital representation.
%% It takes that signal, `samples' its intensity at
%% discrete intervals and yields a stream of signed integer
%% values.
%% By replaying those values to a speaker at the same
%% speed and intensity, a close approximation of the
%% original signal is produced.

%% Let's take some example bytes from a CD-quality PCM stream:

%% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
%% 1B 00 43 FF  1D 00 45 FF  1C 00 4E FF  1E 00 59 FF
%% \end{Verbatim}

%% CD-quality is 16-bit, 2 channel, 44100Hz.
%% 16-bit means those bytes are split into 16-bit signed, little-endian samples.
%% Therefore, our bytes are actually the integer samples:

%% \begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
%% 27 -189 29 -187 28 -178 30 -167
%% \end{Verbatim}

%% The number of channels indicates how many speakers the signal
%% supports.
%% 2 channels means the samples are sent to 2 different speakers.
%% PCM interleaves its samples, sending one sample to
%% each channel simultaneously before moving on to the next set.
%% In the case of 2 channels, the first sample is sent to the
%% left speaker and the second is sent to the right speaker.
%% So, our stream of data now looks like:

%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% \begin{tabular}{| r | l |}
%% \hline
%% left speaker & right speaker \\
%% \hline
%% \texttt{27} & \texttt{-189} \\
%% \texttt{29} & \texttt{-187} \\
%% \texttt{28} & \texttt{-178} \\
%% \texttt{30} & \texttt{-167} \\
%% \hline
%% \end{tabular}
%% \end{figure}

%% \noindent
%% 44100Hz means those pairs of samples are sent at the rate of
%% 44100 per second.
%% Thus, our set of 4 samples takes precisely 1/11025th of a second
%% when replayed.

%% A channel-independent block of samples is commonly referred to
%% as a `frame'.
%% In this example, we have a total of 4 PCM frames.
%% However, the term `frame' appears a lot in digital audio.
%% It is important not to confuse a PCM frame with a CD frame
%% (a block of audio 1/75th of a second long), an MP3 frame,
%% a FLAC frame or any other sort of frame.

%% \clearpage

%% \section{Bitstreams}
%% \label{bitstreams}
%% Many formats are broken up into pieces smaller than an individual byte.
%% As an example, let's take a 32-bit structure of data broken up into 5
%% fields as follows:
%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% \includegraphics{figures/bitstream_struct.pdf}
%% \end{figure}
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% Note that field A is 2 bits, B is 3 bits, C is 5 bits, D is 3 bits
%% and E is 19 bits.
%% \par
%% Given the bytes \texttt{B1 ED 3B C1} in hexadecimal,
%% how we place those bytes within our structure depends
%% whether or not our stream is big-endian or little-endian.
%% For big-endian, the breakdown is largely intuitive:
%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% \includegraphics{figures/bitstream_bigendian.pdf}
%% \end{figure}
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% \begin{tabular}{c r r r}
%% field & base-2 & base-16 & base-10 \\
%% \hline
%% A & \texttt{10} & \texttt{2} & \texttt{2} \\
%% B & \texttt{110} & \texttt{6} & \texttt{6} \\
%% C & \texttt{0 0111} & \texttt{07} & \texttt{7} \\
%% D & \texttt{101} & \texttt{5} & \texttt{5} \\
%% E & \texttt{101 0011 1011 1100 0001} & \texttt{53BC1} & \texttt{342977} \\
%% \end{tabular}
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% However, for little-endian streams, the same bits are read quite differently:
%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% \includegraphics{figures/bitstream_littleendian.pdf}
%% \end{figure}
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% \begin{tabular}{c r r r}
%% field & base-2 & base-16 & base-10 \\
%% \hline
%% A & \texttt{01} & \texttt{1} & \texttt{1} \\
%% B & \texttt{100} & \texttt{4} & \texttt{4} \\
%% C & \texttt{0 1101} & \texttt{0D} & \texttt{13} \\
%% D & \texttt{011} & \texttt{3} & \texttt{3} \\
%% E & \texttt{110 0000 1001 1101 1111} & \texttt{609DF} & \texttt{395743} \\
%% \end{tabular}
%% \clearpage
%% This arrangement seems bizarre and counterintuitive when using
%% the same hexadecimal-to-binary conversion we've been using
%% thus far.
%% However, if we \textit{reverse} our conversion process
%% and place the least-significant bits on the left, as follows:
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% \begin{tabular}{| c | c | c || c | c | c |}
%% \hline
%% Hex & Binary & Decimal & Hex & Binary & Decimal \\
%% \hline
%% 0 & 0 0 0 0 & 0 & 8 & 0 0 0 1 & 8 \\
%% 1 & 1 0 0 0 & 1 & 9 & 1 0 0 1 & 9 \\
%% 2 & 0 1 0 0 & 2 & A & 0 1 0 1 & 10 \\
%% 3 & 1 1 0 0 & 3 & B & 1 1 0 1 & 11 \\
%% 4 & 0 0 1 0 & 4 & C & 0 0 1 1 & 12 \\
%% 5 & 1 0 1 0 & 5 & D & 1 0 1 1 & 13 \\
%% 6 & 0 1 1 0 & 6 & E & 0 1 1 1 & 14 \\
%% 7 & 1 1 1 0 & 7 & F & 1 1 1 1 & 15 \\
%% \hline
%% \end{tabular}
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% The bytes \texttt{B1 ED 3B C1} are then laid out differently also
%% and can now be read in a linear fashion:
%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% \includegraphics{figures/bitstream_littleendian_alt.pdf}
%% \end{figure}
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% As a further example of how this works, we'll convert the first
%% four fields' binary digits to base-10:
%% \begin{align*}
%% \text{A} &= (1 \times 2^0) + (0 \times 2^1) = 1 \\
%% \text{B} &= (0 \times 2^0) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^2) = 4 \\
%% \text{C} &= (1 \times 2^0) + (0 \times 2^1) + (1 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^3) + (0 \times 2^4) = 13 \\
%% \text{D} &= (1 \times 2^0) + (1 \times 2^1) + (0 \times 2^2) = 3
%% \end{align*}
%% \par
%% \noindent
%% Computing field E is left as an exercise for the reader.
%% \par
%% Naturally, these fields from the same bytes have the same values as before;
%% only our way of visualizing them has changed.
