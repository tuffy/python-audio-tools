    <option long="cue" arg="filename">
      A cuesheet or cdrdao(1) TOC file to use when writing.
      If given, the created CD will have the same track layout and metadata
      as the cuesheet.
      This makes the burned CD identical to the original.
    </option>
    <option short="j" long="joint" arg="processes">
      The maximum number of tracks to convert to temporary files at one time.
      If one has multiple CPUs or CPU cores, allowing

      to use all of them simultaneously can reduce the time needed
      to decode tracks prior to CD burning.

      The level of output to display.
      Choose between 'normal', 'quiet' and 'debug'.
