# Python Audio Tools can make use of additional libraries
# to support optional functionality.  Possible values are:

# probe - First use pkg-config(1) to find the given library
#         and use its output to link to it correctly.
#         If pkg-config(1) is not available, look for a binary
#         that typically accompanies the library
#         (such as cd-info(1) with libcdio) and link to the library
#         with typical defaults if present.
#
#   yes - Assume the library is present and link to it with default settings.
#
#    no - Assume the library is not present and disable its functionality.
